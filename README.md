This repository contains assignments and labs of **ROB521 - Mobile Robotics** course offered at the University of Toronto by Prof. Steven Waslander in Winter 2022.

The course covers all important concepts of a robotics system - planning, perception, state estimation and control. Solutions to the assignments and labs are implementation of mine or my course team as a whole. 

Some video demonstrations:
